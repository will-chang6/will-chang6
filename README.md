ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on <a href='https://github.com/will-chang6/daily-dharma-app'> **Daily Dharma App** </a>, a mental health and journaling webapp. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any full-stack projects that you are passionate about. Let's get problem solving! 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my love for Javascript and mindfulness practices for wellness and sports performance.  

ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** william.chaang@gmail.com

ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** He/Him/His

âš¡ **Fun fact:** I grew up in Taipei and have always straddled the American and Taiwanese cultures. I live for experiencing local foods, immersing myself in nature, and hearing people's stories.
